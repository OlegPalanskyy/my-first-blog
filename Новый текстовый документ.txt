Warning our API is new and in beta and not officially supported, and may change at any time, and it is not to be relied upon, and may cause unpredictable growth of extra ears. Extra ears not guaranteed.

Use this token for our API by setting a request header called Authorization, followed by Token token, eg

import requests
username = 'ImCotop'
token = '4f24b527c75fadea0bc7a21a7a257ea3326f7d6e'

response = requests.get(
    'httpswww.pythonanywhere.comapiv0user{username}cpu'.format(
        username=username
    ),
    headers={'Authorization' 'Token {token}'.format(token=token)}
)
if response.status_code == 200
    print('CPU quota info')
    print(response.content)
else
    print('Got unexpected status code {} {!r}'.format(response.status_code, response.content))
                        
TIP Your API token is also available from pythonanywhere consoles, tasks and webapps, as an Environment Variable, $API_TOKEN
